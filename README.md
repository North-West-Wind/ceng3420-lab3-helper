This is a website I made to make the process of editing the `uop` file much easier. You may access it at https://www.northwestw.in/uop-editor

## Usage
Please use a computer. No mobile support planned.

Open your `uop` file and copy all of its content and paste it into the input box. If the content is valid, the UI on the right should change.

The signals of a state are categorized into 6 categories. Each signal label has a square next to it representing its value (red = 0, green = 1, orange = x). Labels marked with a * are the ones you want to edit.

To edit another state, click on the arrow next to "State: X". Double arrows will jump to states where there are signals to be edited.
